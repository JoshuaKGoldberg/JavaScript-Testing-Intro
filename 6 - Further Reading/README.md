# Further Reading

First check out the official documentation for the projects today:
* [Mocha](mochajs.org)
* [Chai](chaijs.com)
* [Sinon](sinonjs.org)

Then read the Wikipedia articles on the ideas to get a more full understanding of the logic and consequences behind them:
* [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
* [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)
* [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)

A fantastic set of tooling that wraps all of this up together is [Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) with the Gherkin syntax.
Definitely play around with that.

Finally, read the [Art of Unit Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Unit-Testing-examples/dp/1617290890).
It's a great little read* that's jam packed with excellent tips for writing good tests.

Finally, feel free to follow up with me at [jogol@microsoft.com] with any questions or comments you have.
I'm always open to learning.

Thanks for listening!
