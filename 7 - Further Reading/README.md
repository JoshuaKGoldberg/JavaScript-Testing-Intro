# Further Reading

First check out the official documentation for the projects today:
* [Mocha]()
* [Chai]()
* [Sinon]()
* [Cucumber]()

Then read the Wikipedia articles on the ideas to get a more full understanding of the logic and consequences behind them:
* TDD
* BDD
* SOLID

Finally, read the [Art of Unit Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Unit-Testing-examples/dp/1617290890).
It's a great little read* that's jam packed with excellent tips for writing good tests.

Finally, feel free to follow up with me at [jogol@microsoft.com] with any questions or comments you have.
I'm always open to learning.

Thanks for listening!
